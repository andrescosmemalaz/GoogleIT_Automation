# Pointers for Getting Your Environment Setup
# Installing Python and additional modules
# If you don't have Python installed yet, we recommend that you visit the official Python website and download the installer that corresponds to your operating system.

# There’s a bunch of guides out there for installing Python and they all follow a similar process to the one we described in the videos. This guide from Real Python includes instructions on how to install python on a range of different operating systems and distributions.

# Once you have Python installed on your operating system, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with pip and the associated tools. You can find more info about these here.


# Using package management systems
# Package management systems help you better manage the software installed on your machine. These management systems vary a lot from operating system to operating system. So, you need to pick the one that works for the OS you’re using. Check out these guides for help with this:

# Installing Python 3 on Windows 10 with Chocolatey

# Setting up Your Environment

# These are some of the common editors for Python, available for all platforms:

# Atom
# Eclipse
# PyCharm
# Sublime Text
# Visual Studio Code
# You can read more about these editors, and others, in these overview comparatives:
